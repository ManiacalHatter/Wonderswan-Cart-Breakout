# Wonderswan-Cart-Breakout
A breakout board project for Wonderswan (requires a cart slot)

This is a design I'm working on that is just to make it easier to connect to individual pins on the
wonderswan cartridge slot. This requires cannibalizing a broken 'swan, but I am also working on
recreating the cart slot in another project (link tbd).

NOTE: Currently, the pin spacing isn't quite right, the slot will not solder correctly.
